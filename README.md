Object oriented programming or "OOP" for short generally refers to a programminng pattern in which real life things are defined as objects. The methods and properties of these objects generally refer to the real-life object's behaviours and properties

Object oriented programming would be suitable when many real life concepts are employed. For example, a card game has a deck, players, cards in play, time. Object oriented programming would be more effective than other patterns in situations like this.

Another example of a project that would greatly benefit from an oop would be  notes app. With a notes app the obvious function would be to store simple text data. The user could input and store his notes as an object. The properties being the note date, name and actual note content. The uer could first create the object upon opening the app. updating the object would simply be writing in the note. reading the note could be done by displaying the object details in a systematic manner.(iterating thought the list keys and displaying the date name and list contents). Deleting the list would simply be changing the list content to an empty string or the entire object to an empty object//

The main Object would be the user. its properties being his name and other details. This user object could also have a objects within it(the note objects). The parent object could also have method which takes in one variable(the note key). The method would then display the note data in a systematic manner. The note data would be an object with a name string, date string and a long string containing the note content.
